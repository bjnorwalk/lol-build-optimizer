# RiftGuide

A League of Legends build-planning prototype built with React and TypeScript.
Choose a champion, role, and matchup to compare item choices. The recommendation
logic scores damage, healing, shields, and other enemy-team threats, then explains
why an item fits the selected game state.

[Open the static demo](https://bjnorwalk.github.io/riftguide/).
Champion and item planning runs in the browser. Account features need the optional
server described below.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 24.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:5174](http://127.0.0.1:5174). The app combines local profiles and
guides with Riot Data Dragon. A network connection is needed for uncached static
data. Selections can be shared through the URL, and saved plans use localStorage.

## Optional account features

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Riot API key. Start the proxy in a second
terminal:

```sh
npm run api
```

Vite forwards `/api` requests to port 8787. Match history, timelines, and ladder
sampling need this server and a valid key. The key stays on the server. Cached
account and match data are not included in the repository.

## Checks

```sh
npm test
npm run build
```

The build runs TypeScript before bundling the frontend. Tests cover champion data,
recommendation behavior, and Riot ID parsing. There is no separate lint script.

## Implementation

| Location                            | Responsibility                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/recommender.ts`                | Item scoring and recommendation explanations          |
| `src/data/`                         | Profiles, guides, matchup data, and source references |
| `src/dataDragon.ts`                 | Riot static data                                      |
| `src/urlState.ts`, `src/storage.ts` | Shared selections and saved plans                     |
| `server/riotApi.mjs`                | Credentialed Riot API proxy                           |

## Limits

Some tier, win-rate, confidence, and guide values are seeded or estimated.
Source-checked profiles are distinguished from profiles calculated from champion
and role tags. These values are not a comprehensive live statistical sample.

The manual Pages workflow deploys only the frontend. Riot account features need
a separately hosted proxy and do not run on a standalone Pages site.

League of Legends and related content belong to Riot Games. This project is not
endorsed by Riot Games. Data references are kept in `src/data/`.
